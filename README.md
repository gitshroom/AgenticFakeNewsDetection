## 📌 Introduction

Facebook remains one of the world’s largest social media platforms and a primary source of information for many users. However, it is also a major channel for the rapid spread of fake news—often combining text and images to appear more credible. Traditional detection approaches typically focus on a single modality, limiting their effectiveness in analyzing real-world misinformation.

This project introduces a **multimodal, agentic AI framework** designed to analyze Facebook posts more intelligently. By combining text processing, image understanding, and automated fact-checking through coordinated AI agents, the system aims to emulate human reasoning and provide a more robust method for identifying misinformation.

## 🧠 Methodology Overview

The system is built using **LangChain**, leveraging its agent orchestration capabilities to coordinate multiple specialized agents. The framework consists of the following components:

### **1. Content Extraction Agent**
Extracts text and images from a Facebook post for further analysis.

### **2. Query Generation Agent**
Converts extracted content into targeted search queries for fact-checking.

### **3. Retrieval Agent**
Searches and gathers supporting or contradicting information from credible online sources.

### **4. Analysis Agent**
Evaluates the Facebook post by comparing it with retrieved evidence using multimodal reasoning techniques.

### **5. Decision Agent**
Classifies the post as **real**, **misleading**, or **fake** based on cross-checked data.

### **6. Explanation Agent**
Generates a clear, concise explanation summarizing how the final classification was reached.

## ⚙️ Summary

This project integrates multimodal AI and agentic reasoning to produce a more adaptive and accurate fake news detection system. By structuring the process into cooperating agents, the framework mirrors the logical steps taken by human fact-checkers while benefiting from the scalability and automation of AI.
